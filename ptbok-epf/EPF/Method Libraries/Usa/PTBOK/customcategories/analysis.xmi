  <mainDescription>This phase refers to how data results from the monitoring are processed and represented in performance testing reports. To&#xD;
be successful in test analyzing, data must first be compared with the test objective. &lt;br />&#xD;
By understanding the behavior of the SUT, it is possible to draw conclusions based on the data so that reports are&#xD;
generated in the next phase. &lt;br />&#xD;
In addition, in the analysis phase, possible actions can be mapped to correct bottlenecks and unexpected application&#xD;
behaviors. &lt;br />&#xD;
For an adequate analysis it is advisable that the data are presented in a way that facilitates the visualization of these&#xD;
results, either through spreadsheets, tables or charts, the latter facilitating the identification of trends.</mainDescription>
