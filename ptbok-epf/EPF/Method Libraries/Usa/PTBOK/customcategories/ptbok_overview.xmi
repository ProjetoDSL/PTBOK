    Before that we conceptualize the PTBOK components, we present the hierarchical level that we established between the&#xD;
    &quot;executable&quot; components in a Performance Testing.&lt;br />&#xD;
    A stage is at the highest abstraction level of the process and is composed of phases, which in turn are composed of&#xD;
    activities.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Each activity may have one or more tasks performed to achieve its goal.&lt;br />&#xD;
    A task is performed by a Role who is the actor responsible for performing the task in question and these Roles may be&#xD;
    defined in a Role Set, which aggregates a set of Roles with similar functions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
