    <mainDescription>The planning phase is the first performance testing phase. &lt;br />&#xD;
In this phase, some factors are mapped, such as the allocation of resources, be it infrastructure, data and also human&#xD;
resources involved in the test. &lt;br />&#xD;
The general scope of the performance test should be defined during the planning phase. &lt;br />&#xD;
In addition, the identification and analysis of risks as well as information relevant to the test should also be mapped.&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
In summary, the definition of the test occurs in the planning phase.</mainDescription>
