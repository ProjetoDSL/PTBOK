  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This domain has some characteristics similar to the requirements domain.&lt;br />&#xD;
    However, the main difference is that the acceptance criteria have a greater focus on performance testing business&#xD;
    rules, with an approach more focused on the results and metrics that must be collected, while the requirements domain&#xD;
    looks at the application to be tested and lists the features to be tested.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The main activities in this domain involve identify the response time, throughput, and resource utilization goals and&#xD;
    constraints.&lt;br />&#xD;
    In general, response time is a user concern, throughput is a business concern, and resource utilization is a system&#xD;
    concern.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Additionally, identify project success criteria that may not be captured by those goals and constraints; for example,&#xD;
    using performance tests to evaluate what combination of configuration settings will result in the most desirable&#xD;
    performance characteristics.&#xD;
