  <mainDescription>Tools are extremely important for performance testing, since testing without tools to automate the process is impractical.&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
Therefore, we have a specific domain that deals with the tools and methods used. &lt;br />&#xD;
Tools are available on the market for virtually the entire performance testing life cycle. As for the methods, some&#xD;
approaches to performance testing (load, stress, spike, etc.), as well as techniques (scripting, capture \&amp;amp; replay)&#xD;
should be analyzed and chosen according to the test purpose and context.</mainDescription>
