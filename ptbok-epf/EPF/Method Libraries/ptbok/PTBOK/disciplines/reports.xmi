  <mainDescription>The main objective of the reports is to consolidate and share the results obtained in the test, so they are of considerable&#xD;
importance to be mapped in that specific domain. &lt;br />&#xD;
Reports must be detailed enough to support the performance engineer in making the decision, which may include adaptations&#xD;
and repetitions in the test. &lt;br />&#xD;
A test that does not have reports with relevant information that indicate the application state according to the workload&#xD;
performed, tends to have its usefulness compromised.</mainDescription>
