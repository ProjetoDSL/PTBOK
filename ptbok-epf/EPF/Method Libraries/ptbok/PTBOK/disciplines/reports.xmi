    The main objective of the reports is to consolidate and share the results obtained in the test, so they are of&#xD;
    considerable importance to be mapped in that specific domain.&lt;br />&#xD;
    Reports must be detailed enough to support the performance engineer in making the decision, which may include&#xD;
    adaptations and repetitions in the test.&lt;br />&#xD;
    A test that does not have reports with relevant information that indicate the application state according to the&#xD;
    workload performed, tends to have its usefulness compromised.&#xD;
