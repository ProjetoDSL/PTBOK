    In order to obtain a clear definition of the requirements of the performance test, an understanding of&#xD;
    thefunctionalities of the application that must be submitted to the test is necessary. For this, the&#xD;
    PerformanceEngineer can make use of known requirements elicitation techniques, since there is no clear understandingof&#xD;
    what features should be tested. However, in a scenario where the main functionalities to be submitted tothe test are&#xD;
    known, it is up to the Performance Analyst, through the Project phase, to define the main inputsand expected results&#xD;
    for the test, as well as issues related to Workload, Ramp Up and Ramp Down. Docu-menting requirements through models is&#xD;
    important to ensure that the applicationâ€™s test history is available,thus seeking greater ease in the evolution and&#xD;
    replication of application performance tests.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
