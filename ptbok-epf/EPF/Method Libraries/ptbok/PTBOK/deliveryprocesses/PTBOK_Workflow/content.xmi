    <mainDescription>The planning phase is the first performance testing phase. &lt;br />&#xD;
In this phase, some factors are mapped, such as the allocation of resources, be it infrastructure, data and also human&#xD;
resources involved in the test. &lt;br />&#xD;
The general scope of the performance test should be defined during the planning phase. &lt;br />&#xD;
In addition, the identification and analysis of risks as well as information relevant to the test should also be mapped.&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
In summary, the definition of the test occurs in the planning phase.</mainDescription>

    <refinedDescription>This activity is the first project activity in the process. &lt;br />&#xD;
The main project inputs are the test objectives and the SUT information, which may be founded in the Performance Testing&#xD;
Requirements Specification. &lt;br />&#xD;
After extracting this information, there are already subsidies for the creation of Performance Testing Design.&lt;br />&#xD;
This initial document may contain some preliminary design information, evolved from the test specifications, such as the&#xD;
intended approach, resource allocation, strategies, etc. &lt;br />&#xD;
However, the test project is still immature at this stage, so there is no need for a detailed project detail at this&#xD;
moment.</refinedDescription>

    <refinedDescription>An application may contain different user profiles, which have distinct characteristics that need to be detailed for the&#xD;
test to run more closely to the actual application usage environment. &lt;br />&#xD;
Therefore, this activity aims to map these profiles.</refinedDescription>

    <refinedDescription>Mapping the main usage scenarios of the application is essential for proper test execution. &lt;br />&#xD;
A key scenario has some peculiarities that characterize it, gathering access characteristics of a user profile with the&#xD;
related functionalities, as well as the flow in which they occur.&lt;br />&#xD;
In this activity, the main scenarios are extracted and the Performance Testing Plan is updated with this information.</refinedDescription>

    <refinedDescription>After obtaining the main user profiles and key scenarios, it is necessary to make a relationship between them. For this,&#xD;
profiles are allocated to the scenarios, and the Performance Testing Plan is implemented with this information.</refinedDescription>

    <refinedDescription>Environment information is analyzed in this activity. &lt;br />&#xD;
This includes both information about the application's production environment and information about the test environment&#xD;
that will be used in the test run. Environment planning includes possible requests for resources that can be made. Thus, in&#xD;
addition to environmental planning, the Testing Environment Request should be added to the Performance Testing Plan.</refinedDescription>

    <refinedDescription>During planning, we can choose tools to support the test. &lt;br />&#xD;
For that, we have to analyze the list of tools and choose the most appropriate for the context. &lt;br />&#xD;
After that, it is important to register in the Performance Testing Plan the justification and what requirements will be&#xD;
covered with the use of the tool.</refinedDescription>

    <refinedDescription>Choosing the appropriate method for the test is an important task, as the method must meet what is expected for the test.&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
For this, we extract the necessary information from the specification document and then update the Performance Testing&#xD;
Design. &lt;br />&#xD;
The list of approaches assists in the definition and choice of the method, as it brings the characteristics of each of the&#xD;
methods and approaches used in the performance test. &lt;br />&#xD;
This choice involves both issues of approaches (load, stress, spike, volume) as well as questions specific to the method&#xD;
such as MBT, CR, among others.&lt;br />&#xD;
This activity ends the test planning activities.</refinedDescription>

    <refinedDescription>As the first design activity, occurs the test data definition. &lt;br />&#xD;
For this, the type of approach is selected, for example, random or database-based, for data acquisition. After that, we&#xD;
perform the test data definition and the execution plan inclusion in Performance Testing Design.&lt;br />&#xD;
This activity chooses the main test inputs. &lt;br />&#xD;
Therefore, they should reflect inputs as close as possible to the application production environment.</refinedDescription>

    <refinedDescription>This activity has a relatively simple definition, summarizing the creation of the scripts and models used in the test. For&#xD;
that, for this creation, we must follow the planning. The tool that was chosen to create the models and scripts and perform&#xD;
the test directly influences this activity.</refinedDescription>

    <refinedDescription>We must map the way the workload behaves according to the approach used (load, stress, volume, etc.) to define the workload&#xD;
project, as each of these approaches has particularities that influence this behavior. Thus, in this activity, the Design&#xD;
Workload is defined and elaborated, which we must attach to the Performance Testing Design.</refinedDescription>
