    <mainDescription>The planning phase is the first performance testing phase. &lt;br />&#xD;
In this phase, some factors are mapped, such as the allocation of resources, be it infrastructure, data and also human&#xD;
resources involved in the test. &lt;br />&#xD;
The general scope of the performance test should be defined during the planning phase. &lt;br />&#xD;
In addition, the identification and analysis of risks as well as information relevant to the test should also be mapped.&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
In summary, the definition of the test occurs in the planning phase.</mainDescription>

    <refinedDescription>In a performance testing, the SUT must deal with different conditions of use, to those conditions mapped with its&#xD;

A scenario maps a given application context, within a determinate workload for a user profile, it should be modeled on&#xD;

In other words, a scenario must reflect real or expected system usage to be useful for performance testing.</refinedDescription>

    <refinedDescription>A script is the main input artifact for running the test. &lt;br />&#xD;
Through it test execution flow is defined, since a script is represented by a set of instructions and may be obtained in an&#xD;

In the former, scripts are generated through tools that use a capture and replay mechanisms.&lt;br />&#xD;
On the latter one, in manual form scripts are generated through a programming language code.</refinedDescription>
