    Performance Testing Guidance for Web Applications provides an end-to-end approach for implementing performance testing.&#xD;
    Whether you are new to performance testing or looking for ways to improve your current performance-testing approach,&#xD;
    you will gain insights that you can tailor to your specific scenarios.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The information in this guide is based on applied use in customer scenarios. It reflects the lessons learned from&#xD;
    multiple performance-testing professionals. The guidance is taskbased and presented in the following parts:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    • Part 1, “Introduction to Performance Testing,” gives you an overview of common types of performance testing, key&#xD;
    concepts, and a set of common terms used in performance testing.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    • Part II, “Exemplar Performance Testing Approaches,” shows you seven core activities for performance testing. This&#xD;
    section also contains information designed to show you how to apply performance testing to different environments,&#xD;
    including Agile and CMMI&amp;reg; software development.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    • Part III, “Identify the Test Environment,” shows you how to collect information about your project that you will need&#xD;
    for your performance tests. This includes collecting information on system architecture, the physical deployment, user&#xD;
    activities, and any relevant batch processes.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    • Part IV, “Identify Performance Acceptance Criteria,” shows you how to determine your performance testing objectives.&#xD;
    You will also learn how to achieve clarity around your various performance goals and requirements, from a performance&#xD;
    testing perspective.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    • Part V, “Plan and Design Tests,” shows you how to model the workload and user experience to design more effective&#xD;
    performance tests.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    • Part VI, “Execute Tests,” walks you through the main activities of actual performance testing.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    • Part VII, “Analyze Results and Report,” shows you how to organize and present your findings in a way that is useful&#xD;
    based on the audience and the intent of the report. • Part VIII, “Performance-Testing Techniques,” shows you the core&#xD;
    techniques for performing load and stress testing.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
