    Software testing is a vital activity that is undertaken during software engineering life cycle to ensure software&#xD;
    quality and reliability. Performance testing is a type of software testing that is done to shows how web application&#xD;
    behaves under a certain workload. Cloud computing as an emerging technology can be used in the field of software&#xD;
    engineering to provide cloud testing in order to overcome all deficiencies of conventional testing by leveraging cloud&#xD;
    computing resources. As a result, testing-as-a-service (TaaS) is introduced as a service model that performs all&#xD;
    testing activities in fully automated manner, on demand with a pay-for use basis. Moreover, TaaS increases testing&#xD;
    efficiency and reduces time and cost required for testing. In this paper, performance TaaS framework for web&#xD;
    applications is introduced which provides all performance testing activities including automatic test case generation&#xD;
    and test execution. In addition, the proposed framework addresses many issues as: maximize resource utilization and&#xD;
    continuous monitoring to ensure system reliability.&#xD;
