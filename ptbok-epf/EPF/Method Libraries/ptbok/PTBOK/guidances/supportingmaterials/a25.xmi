    To satisfy the rapid growth of cloud technologies, a large number of web applications have been developed and deployed,&#xD;
    and these applications are being run in clouds. Due to the scalability provided by clouds, a single web application may&#xD;
    be concurrently visited by several millions or billions of users. Thus, the testing and performance evaluations of&#xD;
    these applications are increasingly important. User model based evaluations can significantly reduce the manual work&#xD;
    required, and can enable us to determine the performance of applications under real runtime environments. Hence, it has&#xD;
    become one of the most popular evaluation methods in both industry and academia. Significant efforts have focused on&#xD;
    building different kinds of models using mining web access logs, such as Markov models and Customer Behavior Model&#xD;
    Graph (CBMG). This paper proposes a new kind of model, named the User Representation Model Graph (URMG), which is built&#xD;
    based on CBMG. It uses an algorithm to refine CBMG and optimizes the evaluations execution process. Based on this&#xD;
    model, an automatic testing and evaluation system for web applications is designed, implemented, and deployed in our&#xD;
    test cloud, which is able to execute all of the analysis and testing operations using only web access logs. In our&#xD;
    system, the error rate caused by random access to applications in the execution phase is also reduced, and the results&#xD;
    show that the error rate of the evaluation that depends on URMG is 50% less than that which depends on CBMG.&#xD;
