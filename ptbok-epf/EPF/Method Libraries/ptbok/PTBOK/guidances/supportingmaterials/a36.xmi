    Performance testing is a highly specialized task, since it requires that a performance engineer knows the application&#xD;
    to be tested, its usage profile, and the infrastructure where it will execute. Moreover, it requires that testing teams&#xD;
    expend a considerable effort and time on its automation. In this paper, we present the PLeTsPerf, a model-based&#xD;
    performance testing tool to support the automatic generation of scenarios and scripts from application models.&#xD;
    PLetsPerf is a mature tool, developed in collaboration with an IT company, which has been used in several works,&#xD;
    experimental studies and pilot studies. We present an example of use to demonstrate the process of generating test&#xD;
    scripts and scenarios from UML models to test a Web application. We also present the lessons learned and discuss our&#xD;
    conclusions about the use of the tool.&#xD;
