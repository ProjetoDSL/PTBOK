    As Web applications evolve, their structures become more and more complex. Web browsers may influence on the&#xD;
    correctness of the Web applications, and Web browser's interactions can cause further complications of Web application.&#xD;
    Existing navigation models are static ones on the whole. Users' navigation paths are all determined on stage of model&#xD;
    design. Web browser interactions have not been taken into account make them different from practical navigation in Web&#xD;
    applications. Moreover, as Web applications evolve and new technologies emerge, adaptive navigation was wildly&#xD;
    incorporated in current Web applications. It aggravates the complexity of Web navigations. In this paper, a practical&#xD;
    approach to modeling of Web applications and generating tests was pro-posed. And special care is taken on Web browser's&#xD;
    interactions and adaptive navigation during the user's traversal within hypermedia space. At last, test generation is&#xD;
    given out which satisfy the corresponding coverage.&#xD;
