    To appropriately realize the performance of a web service, it is essential to give it a comprehensive testing. Although&#xD;
    an elastic test could be guaranteed in traditional cloud testing systems, the geographical test that supports real user&#xD;
    behavior simulation remains a problem. In this paper, we propose a testing system based on a crowdsourcing model to&#xD;
    carry out the distributed test on a target web server automatically. The proposed crowdsourcing-based testing system&#xD;
    (CTS) provides a reliable testing model to simulate real user web browsing behaviors with the help of web browsers&#xD;
    scattered all around the world. In order to make the entire test process the same as the real situation, two test modes&#xD;
    are proposed to simulate real user activity. By evaluating every single resource of web service automatically, a tester&#xD;
    can not only find out internal problems but also understand the performance of the web service. In addition, the&#xD;
    complete geographical test is available with the performance measurements coming from different regions in the world.&#xD;
    Several experiments are performed to validate the functionality and usability of CTS. It demonstrates that CTS is a&#xD;
    complete and reliable web service testing system, which provides unique functions and satisfies different requirements.&#xD;
