    Web server performance in a distributed Object-Oriented (OO) environment is a complex interplay between a variety of&#xD;
    factors (e.g., hardware platform, threading model, object scope model, server operating system, network bandwidth, disk&#xD;
    file size, caching). In this paper, we present a model-based approach to Web Server performance evaluation in terms of&#xD;
    an end-to-end queueing model implemented in a simulation tool. We have applied this model to Active Server Page (ASP)&#xD;
    and Common Object Model (COM) technology in Microsoft's Internet Information Server and to the Java Server Page (JSP)&#xD;
    and JavaBean technology in both IIS and Netscape Enterprise Server (NES). Our results indicate that for the ASP Script&#xD;
    Engine, performance predictions from the simulation model matched the performance observed in a test environment.&#xD;
    However, for the JSP Script Engine, the model predicted higher throughput than laboratory test results at high load.&#xD;
    This result suggests that Web Server performance can be severely limited by a software bottleneck that causes requests&#xD;
    to be serialized. This may cause a request to wait for some resource (i.e., a lock) as opposed to consuming CPU or&#xD;
    memory. Implications of these results for Web Server performance in general are discussed&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
