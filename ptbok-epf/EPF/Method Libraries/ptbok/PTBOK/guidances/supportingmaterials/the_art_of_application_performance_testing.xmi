&lt;p>&#xD;
    This practical book provides a step-by-step approach to testing mission-critical applications for scalability and&#xD;
    performance before they're deployed -- a vital topic to which other books devote one chapter, if that. Businesses today&#xD;
    live and die by network applications and web services. Because of the increasing complexity of these programs, and the&#xD;
    pressure to deploy them quickly, many professionals don't take the time to ensure that they'll perform well and scale&#xD;
    effectively. The Art of Application Performance Testing explains the complete life cycle of the testing process, and&#xD;
    demonstrates best practices to help you plan, gain approval for, coordinate, and conduct performance tests on your&#xD;
    applications. With this book, you'll learn to: Set realistic performance testing goals Implement an effective&#xD;
    application performance testing strategy Interpret performance test results Cope with different application&#xD;
    technologies and architectures Use automated performance testing tools Test traditional local applications, web-based&#xD;
    applications, and web services (SOAs) Recognize and resolves issues that are often overlooked in performance tests&#xD;
    Written by a consultant with 30 years of experience in the IT industry and over 12 years experience with performance&#xD;
    testing, this easy-to-read book is illustrated with real-world examples and packed with practical advice. The Art of&#xD;
    Application Performance Testing thoroughly explains the pitfalls of an inadequate testing strategy and offers you a&#xD;
    robust, structured approach for ensuring that your applications perform well and scale effectively when the need&#xD;
    arises. &quot;Ian has maintained a vendor-agnostic methodology beautifully in this material. The metrics and graphs, along&#xD;
    with background information provided in his case studies, eloquently convey to the reader, 'Methodology above all,&#xD;
    tools at your discretion...' Ian's expertise shines through throughout the entire reading experience.&quot; -- Matt St.&#xD;
