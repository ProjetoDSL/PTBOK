    Websites usage for universities selection entrance (admission) are most visited websites in daily activity, thus its&#xD;
    performance is critical. The ability of web applications either to control or to process users' requests determines its&#xD;
    reliability. Furthermore, those websites which process students admission in Universitas Brawijaya and Politeknik&#xD;
    Negeri Malang certainly engage massive volume of data and information that requires the highest level of reliability.&#xD;
    Therefore, there is absolutely needed appropriate testing performances to measure the level of a certain application&#xD;
    based on reliability rate. This measurement is used to determine responses, throughput, capability, and system&#xD;
    scalability upon workload given. This research has a contribution to present testing performance concepts, goals,&#xD;
    targets, types, and tools of Apache JMeter which is engaged for web assessment including detects mistake and error that&#xD;
    relates to application performance and helps to improve the level of application performance as expected.&#xD;
