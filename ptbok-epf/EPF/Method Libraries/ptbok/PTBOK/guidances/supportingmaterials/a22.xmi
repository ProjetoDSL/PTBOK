    The microservices architecture provides a new approach to develop applications. As opposed to monolithic applications,&#xD;
    in which the application comprises a single software artifact, an application based on the microservices architecture&#xD;
    is composed by a set of services, each one designed to perform a single and well-defined task. These services allow the&#xD;
    development team to decouple several parts of the application using different frameworks, languages and hardware for&#xD;
    each part of the system. One of the drawbacks for adopting the microservices architecture to develop applications is&#xD;
    testability. In a single application test boundaries can be more easily established and tend to be more stable as the&#xD;
    application evolves, while with microservices we can have a set of hundreds of services that operate together and are&#xD;
    prone to change more rapidly. Each one of these services needs to be tested and updated as the service changes. In&#xD;
    addition, the different characteristics of these services such as languages, frameworks or the used infrastructure have&#xD;
    to be considered in the testing phase. Performance tests are applied to assure that a particular software complies with&#xD;
    a set of non-functional requirements such as throughput and response time. These metrics are important to ensure that&#xD;
    business constraints are respected and to help finding performance bottlenecks. In this paper, we present a new&#xD;
    approach to allow the performance tests to be executed in an automated way, with each microservice providing a test&#xD;
    specification that is used to perform tests. Along with the architecture, we also provide a framework that implements&#xD;
    some key concepts of this architecture. This framework is available as an open source project1.&#xD;
