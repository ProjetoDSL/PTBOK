    This article analyses two most commonly used distributed models in Java: Web services and RMI (Remote Method&#xD;
    Invocation). The paper focuses on regular (unsecured) as well as on secured variants, WS-Security and RMI–SSL. The most&#xD;
    important functional differences are identified and the performance on two operating systems (Windows and Linux) is&#xD;
    compared. Sources of performance differences related to the architecture and implementation are identified. The&#xD;
    overheads related to the usage of security and the influences of JCE (Java Cryptography Extension) security providers&#xD;
    on the performance of secured remote invocations are identified. Finally, the impact of distributed models on design&#xD;
    and implementation of distributed applications is identified and guidelines for improving distributed application&#xD;
    performance in design and implementation stage are provided. The paper contributes to the understanding of functional&#xD;
    and performance related differences between Web services and RMI and their secure variants, WS-Security and RMI–SSL.&#xD;
