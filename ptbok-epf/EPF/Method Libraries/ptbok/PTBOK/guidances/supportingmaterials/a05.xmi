    With ICARUS, we introduce a framework for autonomous video game playing, testing, and bug reporting. We report on the&#xD;
    design rationale, the practical implementation, and its use in game development industry projects. The underlying&#xD;
    solving mechanic is based on discrete reinforcement learning in a dualistic fashion, encompassing volatile short-term&#xD;
    memory as well as persistent long-term memory that spans across distinct game iterations. In combination with&#xD;
    heuristics that reduce the search space and the possibility to employ pre-defined situation-dependent action choices,&#xD;
    the system manages to traverse complete playthrough iterations in roughly the same amount of time that a professional&#xD;
    game tester requires for a speedrun. The ICARUS project was developed at Daedalic Entertainment. The software can be&#xD;
    used to generically run all adventure games built with the popular Visionaire Engine and is currently used for&#xD;
    evaluating daily builds, for large-scale hardware compatibility and performance tests, as well as for semi-supervised&#xD;
    quality assurance playthroughs. The supplementary video depicts real-time solving with active control and observation&#xD;
    via a web control panel.&#xD;
