  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Mutation testing is an effective test adequacy assessment technique. However, there is a high computational cost in&#xD;
    executing the test suite against a potentially large pool of generated mutants. Moreover, there is much effort involved&#xD;
    in filtering out equivalent mutants. Prior work has mainly focused on detecting equivalent mutants after the mutation&#xD;
    generation phase, which is computationally expensive and has limited efficiency. We propose an algorithm to select&#xD;
    variables and branches for mutation as well as a metric, called FunctionRank, to rank functions according to their&#xD;
    relative importance from the application's behaviour point of view. We present a technique that leverages static and&#xD;
    dynamic analysis to guide the mutation generation process towards parts of the code that are more likely to influence&#xD;
    the program's output. Further, we focus on the JavaScript language, and propose a set of mutation operators that are&#xD;
    specific to Web applications. We implement our approach in a tool called MUTANDIS. The results of our empirical&#xD;
    evaluation show that (1) more than 93 percent of generated mutants are non-equivalent, and (2) more than 75 percent of&#xD;
    the surviving non-equivalent mutants are in the top 30 percent of the ranked functions.&#xD;
