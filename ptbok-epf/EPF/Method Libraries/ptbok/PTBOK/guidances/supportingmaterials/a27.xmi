    Several models of software testing effort estimation take into account intrinsic characteristics for the whole software&#xD;
    development, presenting no evidence of how they effectively affect the test effort. Also, most of such estimation&#xD;
    models only estimate the effort regarding the execution of tests. However, in software testing projects the activity&#xD;
    usually requiring more effort is the test design &amp;amp; implementation one. Better precision in the identification of&#xD;
    the effort factors influencing these activities can result in estimates with a higher degree of accuracy. Therefore,&#xD;
    this paper presents a study on the factors affecting the effort in performing test design &amp;amp; implementation of&#xD;
    large-scale software projects in a Brazilian government company. The study was carried out through observing the&#xD;
    factors influencing the effort in two Web Services testing projects. The identified factors were made explicit through&#xD;
    a clear description procedure, which took into account the tasks and artifacts comprising the duties regarding test&#xD;
    design &amp;amp; implementation activity based on IEEE 29119 standard. It supported the identification and classification&#xD;
    of 24 effort factors concerned with a Web Services test design &amp;amp; implementation process into five different&#xD;
    categories.&#xD;
