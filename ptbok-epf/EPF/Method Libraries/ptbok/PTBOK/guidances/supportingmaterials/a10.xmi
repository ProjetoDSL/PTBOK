    One of the essential activities for quality assurance in software development is the software testing. Studies report&#xD;
    that Software Testing is one of the most costly activities in the development process, can reach up to 50 percent of&#xD;
    its total cost. One of the great challenges of conducting software testing is related to the automation of a mechanism&#xD;
    known as &quot;test oracle&quot;. This work presents an approach based on machine learning (ML) for automation of the test oracle&#xD;
    mechanism in software. The approach uses historical usage data from an application captured by inserting a capture&#xD;
    component into the application under test. These data go through a Knowledge Discovery in Database step and are then&#xD;
    used for training to generate an oracle suitable for the application under test. Four experiments were executed with&#xD;
    web applications to evaluate the proposed approach. The first and second experiments were performed with a fictitious&#xD;
    application, with faults inserted randomly in the first experiment, inserted by a developer in the second one and&#xD;
    inserted by mutation tests in third one. The fourth experiment was carried out with a large real application in order&#xD;
    to assure the results of the preliminary experiments. The experiments presented indications of the suitability of the&#xD;
    approach to the solution of the problem.&#xD;
