    Advertising servers play an important role in the entire contrary e-business. In this paper an approach for a high&#xD;
    performance ad server is proposed. A prototype of a new architecture is presented: system achieving scalability by&#xD;
    multiplication of ad servers with separate local memory storage and single managing server for entire cluster of those,&#xD;
    providing data processing and ads preparation. The paper includes benchmarks of alternate technologies possible at the&#xD;
    design stage, results of the stress tests of the prototype, as well as the data from its performance with real web&#xD;
    traffic. Limitations of the proposed solution are discussed. Although the prototype is created on a specific platform,&#xD;
    all technologies used are widely available or have replacements on other platforms, granting generality to the proposed&#xD;
    solution.&#xD;
