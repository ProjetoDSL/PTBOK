    User-session-based testing of web applications gathers user sessions to create and continually update test suites based&#xD;
    on real user input in the field. To support this approach during maintenance and beta testing phases, we have built an&#xD;
    automated framework for testing web-based software that focuses on scalability and evolving the test suite&#xD;
    automatically as the application's operational profile changes. This paper reports on the automation of the replay and&#xD;
    oracle components for web applications, which pose issues beyond those in the equivalent testing steps for traditional,&#xD;
    stand-alone applications. Concurrency, nondeterminism, dependence on persistent state and previous user sessions, a&#xD;
    complex application infrastructure, and a large number of output formats necessitate developing different replay and&#xD;
    oracle comparator operators, which have tradeoffs in fault detection effectiveness, precision of analysis, and&#xD;
    efficiency. We have designed, implemented, and evaluated a set of automated replay techniques and oracle comparators&#xD;
    for user-session-based testing of web applications. This paper describes the issues, algorithms, heuristics, and an&#xD;
    experimental case study with user sessions for two web applications. From our results, we conclude that testers&#xD;
    performing user-session-based testing should consider their expectations for program coverage and fault detection when&#xD;
    choosing a replay and oracle technique.&#xD;
