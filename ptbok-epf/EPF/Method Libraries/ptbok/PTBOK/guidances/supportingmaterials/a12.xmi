    It is well known that errors caught in the early stages of system development life cycle greatly helped reduce the&#xD;
    expense for later error fixing and mitigate risks and complications. Performance analysis is one of the methods to&#xD;
    ensure satisfactory system performance that can avoid redesign and patch in the later stage of system development when&#xD;
    performance problems emerge. Much work has been done to address such concerns collectively known as the ‘performance&#xD;
    engineering’ problem. However, a comprehensive method is still needed to provide an end-to-end support for performance&#xD;
    evaluation on software architecture design. Automated tools to support the method must be developed, and its validation&#xD;
    must be carefully planned and conducted. In response to this need, we propose our approach, PSIM (performance&#xD;
    simulation and modeling). PSIM is a performance simulation and modeling tool that integrated performance properties&#xD;
    into software architecture specifications expressed in several major UML diagrams. PSIM models can be transformed into&#xD;
    Colored GSPN (colored generalized stochastic Petri nets) via an automated tool. As a result, the Colored GSPN models&#xD;
    can be simulated to perform model-based performance evaluation. In this paper PSIM is first briefly reviewed and&#xD;
    illustrated through modeling a web-based electronic conferencing system, called M-Net, to derive performance metrics.&#xD;
    We then conduct runtime performance testing to the implementation of M-Net and compare the simulation results against&#xD;
    the runtime testing data. PSIM is shown to be effective in predicting system performance and in identifying system&#xD;
    performance bottlenecks through this experimentation.&#xD;
