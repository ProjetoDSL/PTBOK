  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Distributed analysis of LHC data is an I/O-intensive activity which places large demands on the internal network,&#xD;
    storage, and local disks at remote computing facilities. Commissioning and maintaining a site to provide an efficient&#xD;
    distributed analysis service is therefore a challenge which can be aided by tools to help evaluate a variety of&#xD;
    infrastructure designs and configurations. HammerCloud is one such tool; it is a stress testing service which is used&#xD;
    by central operations teams, regional coordinators, and local site admins to (a) submit arbitrary number of analysis&#xD;
    jobs to a number of sites, (b) maintain at a steady-state a predefined number of jobs running at the sites under test,&#xD;
    (c) produce web-based reports summarizing the efficiency and performance of the sites under test, and (d) present a&#xD;
    web-interface for historical test results to both evaluate progress and compare sites. HammerCloud was built around the&#xD;
    distributed analysis framework Ganga, exploiting its API for grid job management. HammerCloud has been employed by the&#xD;
    ATLAS experiment for continuous testing of many sites worldwide, and also during large scale computing challenges such&#xD;
    as STEP'09 and UAT'09, where the scale of the tests exceeded 10,000 concurrently running and 1,000,000 total jobs over&#xD;
    multi-day periods. In addition, HammerCloud is being adopted by the CMS experiment; the plugin structure of HammerCloud&#xD;
    allows the execution of CMS jobs using their official tool (CRAB)&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
