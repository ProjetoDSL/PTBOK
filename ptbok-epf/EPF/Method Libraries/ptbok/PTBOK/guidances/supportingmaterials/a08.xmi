    The performance of multi-service applications are known to be determined mainly by the interactions between workload&#xD;
    and behaviors of the application. The change of workload can lead to dynamic service demands on system resources, and&#xD;
    even cause dynamic bottleneck switches between services inside the application. In this paper, to profiling&#xD;
    large-applications' behaviors, and help to locate the bottleneck and optimize their capacities, we focus on modeling&#xD;
    their behavior according to the workload. Although this topic has been well studied at testing stage, building such a&#xD;
    model under live workload remains a challenge, because the workload and application behaviors are time-varying. To&#xD;
    tackle this problem, we propose an adaptive approach to build and rebuild performance model according to log files.&#xD;
    Both the user behaviors and their corresponding internal service relations are modeled, and the CPU time consumed by&#xD;
    each service is also obtained through Kalman filter, which can &quot;absorb&quot; some level of noise in real-world data. Our&#xD;
    model can explain the behaviors of both the whole application and the individual services, and provide valuable&#xD;
    information for capacity planning and bottleneck detection. At last, our work is evaluated with TPC-W bench mark, whose&#xD;
    results can demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.&#xD;
