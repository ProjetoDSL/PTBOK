  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The environment of enterprise applications is characterized by frequently changing market demands, time-to-market&#xD;
    pressure and fierce competition. To seamlessly integrate complex computing activities, Web Service Composition (WSC)&#xD;
    has been regarded as an emerging E-Commerce solution to support interoperable machine-to-machine business interactions&#xD;
    over network. To guarantee the composite Web service can be successfully produced, testing is a preferred validation&#xD;
    technique to efficiently verify the correctness of functional and nonfunctional requirements of WSC behaviors. BPEL4WS&#xD;
    is a high level and semi-formal abstract description language for WSC orchestration. Manually generating test cases&#xD;
    from BPEL4WS is tedious, time-consuming, and error prone. Thus, the automated test case generation plays a critical&#xD;
    role in all the phases of Web service life cycle. Considering the uncertain environment, an extended WSC model, namely&#xD;
    probabilistic timed interface automata for Web service (PTIA4WS), is pro-posed to transform and extend BPEL4WS with&#xD;
    regard to the stochastic and time-related behaviors. Based on PTIA4WS model, we propose an approach for generating&#xD;
    quantitative test cases from counterexamples of violated PTCTL formulae using coverage criterions. After that, timed&#xD;
    test case with fastest execution response time and probabilistic test case with maximal execution success rate are&#xD;
    discussed. The series of experiments show that our method gains better performance than traditional methods.&#xD;
