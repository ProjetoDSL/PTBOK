  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>Scenario observation&lt;/b>: Observe and learn about the entire environment in which the user / customer is inserted,&#xD;
    as well as understand what the real problem must be solved. Identify software or business processes, workflows, input&#xD;
    and output artifacts when using the system.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>Interview with stakeholders&lt;/b>: Identify the main problem, the business processes involved and the other needs of&#xD;
    the project.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>Requirements Workshop&lt;/b>: Interview or meeting composed of two or more analysts and a group of stakeholders. As&#xD;
    with brainstorming, it is possible for stakeholders to clarify and detail their needs. In addition to features that you&#xD;
    would like the system to have.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>Table tests&lt;/b>: Check the compliance of a system functionality. To perform a table test, just follow the proposed&#xD;
    flow of a feature or group of features in the software, considering all possible possibilities, until you reach the end&#xD;
    of the flow.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>Market research&lt;/b>: Learn from those who have done it before. Understand and know what solutions already exist for&#xD;
    the problem, but mainly offer an even more efficient and effective solution, with the lowest possible cost and time.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>Survey by points of view&lt;/b>: Know the problem through each point of view of the different stakeholders.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>Ethnography&lt;/b>: The analyst inserts himself into the client's organization and observes the day-to-day work, takes&#xD;
    notes.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>Quiz&lt;/b>: This technique is interesting when we have a large amount of people to extract the same information. The&#xD;
    questions are addressed in writing to the participants in order to get to know their opinions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>Focus Group&lt;/b>: It is a small and informal discussion group (up to 12 people), with the purpose of obtaining&#xD;
    in-depth qualitative information.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>Analysis Protocol&lt;/b>: It is a form of requirements gathering in which stakeholders are analyzed when they are&#xD;
    involved in some type of task.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>Requirements reuse&lt;/b>: Similar to market research. Study and reuse of specifications and glossaries for projects of&#xD;
    legacy systems or systems of the same family (with similar business functionalities).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>Documentation Study / Content Analysis&lt;/b>: Study and reuse of documentation of different natures, to identify&#xD;
    requirements to be implemented in the system being modeled. A wide variety of documentation can be analyzed including&#xD;
    the company's organizational structure, market standards, laws, user manuals, market research reports, glossary of&#xD;
    business terms, etc.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>Laddering&lt;/b>: It is a method of structured interviews, one-by-one, used to survey the knowledge (what is important&#xD;
    and why) of specialists, and which consists in the creation, review and modification of the hierarchy of knowledge of&#xD;
    specialists, usually in the form of hierarchical diagrams (eg tree diagram).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>Repertory Grid&lt;/b>: Method where stakeholders are asked about their attributes and values, referring to a series of&#xD;
    entities. With this information a matrix of entity X attribute is assembled.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>Prototyping&lt;/b>: Used in the initial stage of the project. It helps the stakeholders to develop a strong notion&#xD;
    about the application which has not yet been implemented, that through the visualization of it they can identify the&#xD;
    real requirements and workflows of the system.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>Storyboards&lt;/b>:They are interactive sessions that describe a sequence of activities and events for a specific case&#xD;
    for a generic process that the system is expected to automate.&#xD;
