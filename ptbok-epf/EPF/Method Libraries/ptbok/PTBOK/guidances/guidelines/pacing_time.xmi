  <mainDescription>Pacing time is defined by the waiting time between transactions.&lt;br />&#xD;
The main difference from pacing time to think time is that the think time is the time related only to the wait related to&#xD;
the user's actions.&lt;br />&#xD;
Pacing time is the time between iterations, being composed of the sum of think time, response time and delay between&#xD;
iterations that may come from network latency.</mainDescription>
