  <mainDescription>Think time is a waiting time that the application should emulate, based on a user's real behavior when using the&#xD;
application. &lt;br />&#xD;
For example, in an e-commerce, where the user logs in, chooses a product, means of payment and confirms the purchase, the&#xD;
think time emulate this waiting time between transactions, once in a real scenario the user takes a certain period of time&#xD;
to perform these actions, that is, they do not occur in fractions of seconds, as there is a decision making by the user at&#xD;
each purchase stage.&lt;br />&#xD;
Think time also helps to understand the application's ability to handle concurrent requests. With an increase in waiting&#xD;
time, the server will handle a larger number of sessions at the same time.</mainDescription>
