    Ramp up speed during load test is speed at which new concurrent users are trying to access the application. Usually in&#xD;
    real time every application has its own peak hours where concurrent users tend to increase slowly before the start of&#xD;
    peak time. The speed at which the peak traffic is touched on series of time is known as Ramp up speed of load test. Our&#xD;
    goal always should be to match the ramp up speed with as close to the user pattern.&#xD;
