    By means of a figure, we intend to represent an analysis of the effort employed in each of the phases and stages of&#xD;
    PTBOK according to the related Performance Domains. With regard to Requirements, most of the work is done in the&#xD;
    Planning phase, and there is also a relationship with the Analysis phase. Scripts and Scenarios have greater use in the&#xD;
    Project phase, but they also appear in the Planning phases and also in the test stage, through the Execution and&#xD;
    Monitoring phases. Workload appears only in the Pre-Test stage, most frequently in the Configuration phase. The&#xD;
    Performance Domain Environment is used in the Planning and Design phases but is also related to Monitoring. Acceptance&#xD;
    Criteria is used in the three stages, through the Design, Monitoring, and Analysis phases. Tools and Methods has&#xD;
    slightly greater use in Planning and is also listed in the Execution phase Finally, Performance Domain Reports has a&#xD;
    little effort in the Execution phase, but the vast majority of work in this domain is in the Analysis and mainly&#xD;
    Reporting phases&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
