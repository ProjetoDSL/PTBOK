  <mainDescription>A performance test has three (3) main stages, the first is the stage that precedes the performance test execution&#xD;
activities (Pre-Test stage). &lt;br />&#xD;
The second stage gather the activities carried out in the performance testing execution (Test stage).&lt;br />&#xD;
Finally, activities performed after test execution are carried out in the Post-Test stage.&lt;br />&#xD;
We emphasize that all stages are complementary to each other and necessary, since each of these stages brings together&#xD;
essential characteristics for a performance testing.&lt;br />&#xD;
A relevant issue in relation to the stages is the sequentiality between them, that is, in the way we present, the stages&#xD;
must occur sequentially, since the output from one stage is an input to the subsequent stage.</mainDescription>
